# Launch Code
> Launch a rocket with programming exercises.

Teaching most fundamental principles of programming often is abstract and tough to show in an example that is neither dull nor engulfed in a complex structure. So this tool is a means to span the gap between brief code examples and appealing results. It associates source code tests to animations visualizing success and mistakes in an exercise. The programming language checked currently is TypeScript and the graphics a launching space rocket.

## Build instructions

The project requires an installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) including its own package management system to satisfy all further dependencies. Those modules listed in the _packages.json_ are obtained automatically by executing the following line in the working tree root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

Following that you can run the program from source by executing:

```sh
npm start
```

And you can also use the next line to package the program as a self-containing executable:

```sh
npm run dist
```
